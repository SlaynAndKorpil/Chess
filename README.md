# Chess
This project is mostly for experimental and testing purpose as it is my first project on github.
Don't take it too seriously.

## Components
 0. A backend.
 0. An GUI implementation of the backend.
 0. A console UI.

## Backend
A Framework used to simulate a chess game and capable of storing and computing positions, moves, loading and saving.
When using scala, you can interact with it using the [ChessIO](https://github.com/SlaynAndKorpil/Chess/blob/master/src/main/scala/chess/framework/ChessIO.scala) trait as a pipe for in&output or [JChessIO](
https://github.com/SlaynAndKorpil/Chess/blob/master/src/main/scala/chess/framework/javaInterfacing/JChessIO.java) when you are using java.

## GUI Application

## CLI Application
Use 'console' argument to start in console mode:
> java -jar Chess.jar console
